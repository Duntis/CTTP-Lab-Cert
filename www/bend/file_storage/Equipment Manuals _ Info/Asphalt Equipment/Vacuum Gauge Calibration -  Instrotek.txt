Mary,
We can calibrate the absolute vacuum gauge (Torr gauge).  The calibration 
price is $75.  You can UPS the gauge to us. Make sure you insure it for $600 
and obviously pack it well.  UPS likes throwing things around during shipping.  
Please include return address, instruction to calibrate and any other billing 
information inside the box.
Thanks and have a great weekend.
Ali

Comments: We have Busch Model B40 analog vacuum gauge which was last 
calibrated by InstroTek on July 28, 2009.  The SN is 0907005G.  What will it 
cost to have this gauge recalibrated and what are the proper procedures to do 
so?
